Step 1
Open up your copy of FileZilla, select the ‘Export…’ option from the ‘File’ menu and click the checkbox that reads ‘Export Site Manager entries’. At this point you may also want to select to export your settings and the current transfer queue if one exists.

Step 2
Click ‘OK’ and you’ll be asked where you want to save the exported file to. The export is in the format of an XML file and should be saved in a suitable location.

Step 3
Now we have our FileZilla site manager safe and sound it’s time to look at importing our sites back into FileZilla. To do this, with FileZilla open, select the ‘Import…’ option from the ‘File’ menu and navigate to where the saved XML file is sitting. Simply click ‘OK’ and watch as your settings flood back in. It’s almost as if you were never FileZilla-less.
