# Mac-setup

My Mac OS X development environment setup. Automated setup scripts for developer tools like Sublime Text, iTerm, web development, Android development, and dev-based OS X defaults.


# Reminder
I use this script to fully provision my development machine.
There is a lot of dublicates in the scripts, I need to sort it out.


# Prerequisites

I tried to minimize the manual steps as much as I could. These still remain...

- XCode is installed (via the App Store)
- Install Xcode from the Apple store and accept TOS
- XCode command line tools are installed (xcode-select --install will prompt up a dialog)
